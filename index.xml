      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a list of the podcasts I currently have in my rotation, within the constraint of getting through them in a week. No claims about these being the &#34;best&#34; podcasts, just what I&#39;m listening to now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://99percentinvisible.org/&#34; title=&#34;99% Invisible&#34;&gt;99% Invisible&lt;/a&gt;: A podcast about design, mostly invisible, that shapes our experience of the world. Hosted by Roman Mars, who has possibly the best podcast voice in podcasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.akimbo.me/&#34; title=&#34;Akimbo&#34;&gt;Akimbo&lt;/a&gt;: From Seth Godin, who describes it as &#34;a podcast about our culture and about how we can change it. About seeing what&#39;s happening and choosing to do something.&#34; Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theallusionist.org/&#34; title=&#34;The Allusionist&#34;&gt;The Allusionist&lt;/a&gt;: A podcast about the language, from the other side of the pond. Delightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/the-daily&#34; title=&#34;The Daily&#34;&gt;The Daily&lt;/a&gt;: From the New York Times. Each weekday morning, a look behind one of the important headlines of the day, with host Michael Barbaro talking to a Times journalist who is covering that story. It brings out of the personality of the reporter and the depth of what they know about those stories and the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.cognitect.com/cognicast/&#34; title=&#34;Cognicast&#34;&gt;Cognicast&lt;/a&gt;: A podcast from Cognitect, a software consulting company, about software and the people who make it. Technically, the show draws mostly on the Clojure software world, but many of the stories are about bigger issues in software engineering, engineering, and life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imaginaryworldspodcast.org/&#34; title=&#34;Imaginary Worlds&#34;&gt;Imaginary Worlds&lt;/a&gt;: Eric Molinsky&#39;s bi-weekly podcast about the genres of science fiction and fantasy, especially about how they impossible stories tell us so much about ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/lexicon_valley.html&#34; title=&#34;Lexicon Valley&#34;&gt;Lexicon Valley&lt;/a&gt;: A Slate podcast about language, hosted by John McWhorter, a professor who teaches linguistics, philosophy, and music at Columbia. Endlessly fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/notetoself&#34; title=&#34;Note to Self&#34;&gt;Note to Self&lt;/a&gt;: a terrific podcast from WYNC looking at the ways we use technology now and how that affects ordinary life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/otm/&#34; title=&#34;On The Media&#34;&gt;On The Media&lt;/a&gt;: Another WNYC program, looking at how the media looks at the world and tells us about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://radioopensource.org/&#34; title=&#34;Open Source with Christopher Lydon&#34;&gt;Open Source with Christopher Lydon&lt;/a&gt;: A podcast (and radio program) about &#34;arts, ideas, and politics&#34;, hosted by Christopher Lydon, who has been a fixture on the Boston media scene for decades. He has an astonishing ability to make anything interesting, and talk about it smartly in depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/&#34; title=&#34;Wait Wait...Don&#39;t Tell Me!&#34;&gt;Wait Wait...Don&#39;t Tell Me!&lt;/a&gt;: NPR&#39;s comedy news quiz show. It&#39;s got the best roundup of news I hear in a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.radiotopia.fm/podcasts/trump-con-law&#34; title=&#34;What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law&#34;&gt;What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law&lt;/a&gt;: Whatever one&#39;s political leanings, I think we can agree that the President has given us all a chance to learn about points of the US Constitution we haven&#39;t thought much about before. This show, hosted by constitution law professor Elizabeth Joh and the aforementioned Roman Mars, explores those points for those of us who aren&#39;t lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d like to have more on the list, when time permits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also use &lt;a href=&#34;https://huffduffer.com/&#34; title=&#34;Huffduffer&#34;&gt;Huffduffer&lt;/a&gt;, a marvelous web tool for putting an audio program from a web site into a podcast feed for you. It&#39;s great for listening to random bits of audio from around the web.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coming back to podcasts</title>
      <link>https://temporaryobsessions.github.io/posts/coming-back-to-podcasts/</link>

      <guid>https://temporaryobsessions.github.io/posts/coming-back-to-podcasts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://temporaryobsessions.github.io/posts/giving-up-podcasts/&#34; title=&#34;giving up podcasts&#34;&gt;giving up podcasts&lt;/a&gt;. For a long time, I liked the feeling of a less-cluttered mind, which seemed to be correlated with taking that step. But I still missed them. Partly it was from the random incompletions of listening to the radio in the car. Mostly it was missing some of my favorite voices, bringing some perspectives that I don&#39;t otherwise get to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I started bringing some back, slowly. Adding one at a time, catching up on the last three episodes, just to see if I still wanted to hear that voice. My current rule is to add only as many as I can get through in a week. I don&#39;t want to re-create the backlog, with its pressure to listen, that I had before. And I&#39;m trying to keep a little bit of diversity of voice and topic in the collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, it seems to be working. It&#39;s not stressful, and I&#39;m enjoying it, without giving up chances for my mind to wander and think about my own work as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quiet time is still important, so I&#39;m trying to leave plenty of opportunity for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On giving up podcasts</title>
      <link>https://temporaryobsessions.github.io/posts/giving-up-podcasts/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2018 10:39:06 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://temporaryobsessions.github.io/posts/giving-up-podcasts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last fall, I gave up podcasts. Cold turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Manoush&#39;s fault. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.manoushz.com/&#34; title=&#34;Manoush Zomorodi&#34;&gt;Manoush Zomorodi&lt;/a&gt; hosts the WYNC podcast &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/notetoself&#34; title=&#34;Note to Self&#34;&gt;Note to Self&lt;/a&gt;&#34;, about life with modern technology. She did a series on the show did called &#34;Bored and Brilliant&#34; that turned into a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.manoushz.com/book/&#34; title=&#34;book with the same name.&#34;&gt;book with the same name.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the series, she posed a set of challenges to experience personal technology differently. The last one: delete the app on your phone that is always grabbing your attention. For some, it&#39;s Facebook. For others, Twitter. Or maybe Two Dots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, it was podcasts. Over several years, I had amassed a large collection of podcast subscriptions, and I listened all the time. In the car, doing dishes, on a walk, in the gym, working in the yard. If I wasn&#39;t doing requiring focused mental attention, I was listening, to an eclectic collection that ranged over a wide range of topics. All of them were interesting: stimulating ideas to ponder, things to think about, political issues to be outraged over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, last September, I was outside cleaning up the yard for fall and listening to Brooke Gladstone (of WNYC&#39;s &#34;On the Media&#34; show) interview Manoush after the book came out. She talked about the Bored &amp; Brilliant challenges. And I realized that Overcast was my problem app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t get me wrong. Overcast is a great app, and podcasts are great. But it was time to take a break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t delete it, because I didn&#39;t want to lose the subscription list if I decided to come back. But I did exile it from the home screen on my phone to avoid seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the interview was open, I stopped listening to podcasts. Complete stop. My plan was to try it, as Manoush had challenged, for a week. Which turned into two. And then months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first couple of days I was going crazy. I had to take a 45-minute bus ride to the airport for a sudden trip. I can&#39;t read on a bus, so I usually listen to podcasts. Instead, I stared out the window. Taking a walk, I let my mind wander as I looked at the landscape. In the car, if I put on the radio (which wasn&#39;t always), I put on NPR or (gasp!) commercial radio. I felt like something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a weird effect of going back to listening to radio programs that are also available as podcasts: the radio doesn&#39;t pause when you get out of the car.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That took a little getting used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then something started to happen. Over the next few days, I started to feel calmer. Maybe more focused at times--it&#39;s hard to tell. A lot more mind wandering. Too much time, it seems, with music running through my head that I can&#39;t quite seem to control. Perhaps a few extra ideas out of nowhere. Nothing earth-shattering, but occasional creative solutions to small problems. I mentally composed a note about this, which is, much later, turning into this post, on a walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most, I had thought that the podcasts were a good way of getting exposed to new ideas and information during otherwise mindless time. The experience of stopping showed me that, perhaps, they were getting in the way of my own ideas and putting them together with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not new to say that the mind-wandering time is essential for creativity, or for having the capacity to focus intently at other times. Quitting podcasts gave me a direct experience for the difference, and I like the way it feels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;Actually, a long time ago, some colleagues and I built a system that stored the previous 24 hours of our local NPR station, so you could pause the radio in your office. This was well before DVRs or podcasts, and it completely changed the radio experience, as well as startling some visitors at times. One consequence was that as you walked down our row of offices, you might hear NPR playing from different times of the day! &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>On being intuitively obvious</title>
      <link>https://temporaryobsessions.github.io/posts/intuitively-obvious/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Apr 2018 12:49:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://temporaryobsessions.github.io/posts/intuitively-obvious/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, when I was an undergraduate, it was common to hear someone say that  idea, usually a statement in mathematics, was “intuitively obvious”. I say “statement”, because not everything so labeled was necessarily true. But it was almost always said with irony or sarcasm, as if the phrase was by then overused, cliche, and amusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, however, I happened across a seemingly non-ironic use, in the book &lt;em&gt;Syntactic Structures&lt;/em&gt; by Noam Chomsky.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Consider for example the pair of sentences&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(103) (i)  John knew the boy studying in the library.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(ii)  John found the boy studying in the library.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is intuitively obvious that these sentences have different grammatical structure (this becomes clear, for example, when we attempt to add “not running around in the streets” to (103)), but I do not believe that within the level of phrase structure grounds can be found for analyzing them into different constituents.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding this in a published book started me wondering about the origin of the phrase. With Google Books, we can poke around a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oldest use in a book that I could find is from &lt;em&gt;A Demonstration of Necessary Connexion&lt;/em&gt; by John Fearn, in a philosophical/theological argument against David Hume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All, therefore, that we have to do, to prove, &lt;em&gt;by that abstract argument&lt;/em&gt;, the being of A SELF-EXISTENT
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
FIRST CAUSE &lt;em&gt;of all things&lt;/em&gt;, is, to produce “an instance wherein one event must follow from another as an infallible consequence.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That the first proposal of such a proof should excite as much incredulity as surprise, is to be expected. But,fortunately,the truth of the propositions is so intuitively obvious, that the slightest attention must discern t; and, from the nature of the subject, it is to be hoped that attention will be
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
afforded to them by every person who is in the least degree interested in general knowledge.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other early works that show up mostly seem to be concerned with philosophy or theology. The first reference I found specifically about mathematics comes via the first volume of Charles Richardson&#39;s &lt;em&gt;A New Dictionary of the English Dictionary&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1836.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In his dictionary, Richardson cited Dugald Stewart&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; from 1822, which includes the statement “The truth of mathematical axioms has always been supposed to be intuitively obvious.” But Stewart&#39;s work is ultimately, in fact, about philosophy, not mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m a bit suspicious about how far this gets us, because it took some focused queries to find the Chomsky quotation above; it didn&#39;t show up in the initial search results. &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=intuitively+obvious&amp;amp;year_start=1600&amp;amp;year_end=1825&amp;amp;corpus=15&amp;amp;smoothing=3&amp;amp;share=&amp;amp;direct_url=t1%253B%252Cintuitively%2520obvious%253B%252Cc0#t1%253B%252Cintuitively%2520obvious%253B%252Cc1&#34; title=&#34;Google Ngrams&#34;&gt;Google Ngrams&lt;/a&gt; shows the phrase first showing up in 1790, but I couldn&#39;t persuade it to show me the actual citation, and Wired has previously reported on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/2015/10/pitfalls-of-studying-language-with-google-ngram/&#34; title=&#34;The Pitfalls of Using Google Ngram to Study Language&#34;&gt;The Pitfalls of Using Google Ngram to Study Language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chomsky&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Syntactic Structures&lt;/em&gt; is, in large part, brought some mathematical methods of reasoning to linguistics, at a time when much linguistic thinking still relied on intuitions about language and how it works. But in the time between &lt;em&gt;Syntactic Structures&lt;/em&gt; and the early 1980s, I suspect that the ironic usage of “intuitively obvious” emerged as intuition fell away as a basis for knowledge. Of course, intuition is often essential for new discoveries and insights in science and mathematics, but the intuition must be confirmed (or disproved) by other, more reliable, means. In any case, what is “obvious” to one person is often not “obvious” to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one might expect, the trail on historical usage on a term like this usually peters out into an ocean of antecedents, many of which we will never recover. Nevertheless, it seems interesting to find records of a time when “intuitively obvious” was used earnestly, without the sarcastic flavor it often carries today.&lt;/p&gt;

Compared to Samual Johnson, Richardson included a larger and wider range of quotations from published literature along with definitions, and it has been said that Richardson&#39;s dictionary was a large part of the inspiration for the Oxford English Dictionary. On the other, Richardson was of the school that each word had exactly one meaning. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Interestingly, the scanned copy I found at the Internet Archive was scanned from Harvard&#39;s library, and was the copy “From the books in the homestead of Sarah Orne Jewett at South Berwick, Maine”, which brings things back to reading her novel &lt;em&gt;The Country of the Pointed Firs&lt;/em&gt; as an undergrad, although I don&#39;t recall the phrase “intuitively obvious” ever being used in that literature class. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>What if everyone gets over the bar?</title>
      <link>https://temporaryobsessions.github.io/posts/everyone-over-the-bar/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Apr 2018 12:00:33 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://temporaryobsessions.github.io/posts/everyone-over-the-bar/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Suppose a school had a basketball team, and the coach of the team worked to challenge every player to be the best they could be. Maybe even better. The players developed skills at all positions, and everyone played. There was no regular, default starting lineup, because the players could be selected at random to form a group of five who could play together, and win games, as a team. The players are excited to be there, they work hard together, and they cheer each other on. And they all get to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they win a lot of their games. Often a championship. Not alwayshttps://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/, but mostly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would we think about that coach? As a genius? Maybe it seems impossible, or that couldn&#39;t possibly the right way to coach. But we probably wouldn&#39;t argue much with the results: a team that works hard, values every player, and wins. What&#39;s bad about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let&#39;s imagine a math teacher at a different school. One who sets a high standard of excellence and challenges every student. One who works exceedingly hard to build a team of math students, who cheer each other on, who help each other learn. At the end of the year, every one of those students scores at the top of whatever standard math assessment is current for the school. And every one of them gets an A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, we might say. Grade inflation! The teacher is just handing out the top grades. You can&#39;t possibly have a math class where everyone gets an A. Where&#39;s the bell curve? Who is at the top?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are these cases really that different? The methods seem to be pretty much the same: set a high bar and work like hell to get everyone over it. They do it as a team. They get everyone there, together. And, both cases, we would be happy with the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except for this little nagging feeling that everyone getting an A isn&#39;t right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe that&#39;s the problem we have: the feeling that students have to be ranked. That for some to succeed, some must fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which approach actually serves the students better?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a post about a great idea I had while I was out for a walk yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it&#39;s only &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; the idea. I&#39;m not exploring the idea itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I forgot it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forgot it in the fewer than ten minutes it took me to get home. Or maybe it was because I was too close to home, and the process of going into the house and talking to my family pushed it out of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a pretty good idea. Maybe not an actual great idea, but not bad. Something worth writing about. A little evolution in my thinking on something or other. Or maybe it wasn&#39;t actually that good, and I would have ended up discarding it without writing a word about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I didn&#39;t write it down. Or ask Siri to remind me about it. Why didn&#39;t I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friction and hubris. Friction, in that it was cold outside yesterday. I had gloves on. As it happened, I did have a notebook and pen in my pocket, but they were hard to get to. The phone was similarly inconvenient. It would have meant standing by the side of the road along an awkward curve, feeling exposed, unsafe, and a bit silly standing there scribbling a note. Hubris, in that I thought it was so good and clear that I would remember it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten minutes later, it was gone. My mind had moved on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might come back again. Ideas often do. But not always. Sometimes they move on. Maybe the idea will move on to someone else---Elizabeth Gilbert has written about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do know that more ideas will come. Some not as good, some better. Mostly just different. Or similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time, I will try harder to capture the idea. But if I don&#39;t, I&#39;ll try to get the one after that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Who do you want to be?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A high school principal I know told a story told to her by another principal. It was approximately:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A lot of students ask me what it takes to get into the National Honor Society. But one student stood out for asking a different question: &#34;What is it like to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; a member of the National Honor Society?&#34; (emphasis mine)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question bounced in my mind off something else I heard recently, on a college tour with one of my daughters. There, one of the admissions officials said something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most of our students share the following three characteristics (what they were doesn&#39;t really matter). You don&#39;t have to have all three of these, or two of them, or even one. But you should want to be around people like that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For students looking at colleges, or, in fact, for any of us looking at a new job with a new organization, or a new role of any kind, these questions provide a valuable way of thinking about what to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the characteristics of the people involved?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does that represent the kind of person I am on my way to becoming?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does that represent the kind of person I want to be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I want to spend (a lot of) time with people like that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the answer to any of the last three is &#34;no&#34;, then it doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s the best place to go, no matter how prestigious, ego-boosting, or monetarily rewarding it may be.&lt;/p&gt;
