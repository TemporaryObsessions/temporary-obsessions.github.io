  <p>Should we expect politicians to stand by their decisions?</p>

<p>The Greek philosopher Epictetus, in his <em>Discourses</em>, says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Some people, when they hear arguments such as these, that one should be steadfast,...imagine that they must always adhere unswervingly to every judgement that they have formed. But it necessary first of all that the judgement should be a sound one.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and later:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
...it is not enough to make a decision and refuse to change it. That is the strength of a madman and not of a healthy man.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet we often seem to expect politicians to stick to their positions, no matter what.</p>

<p>There are some good reasons for leadership decisions to be stable. We don't want to be whipsawed by changing decisions, and stability means that we can expect to rely on those decisions for the future. But things can change, and leaders can make mistakes.</p>

<p>Political decisions come from a combination of many factors, including core principles, the facts of a situation, the reasoning behind a decision, and what their constituents want. What we expect, I think, is that the principles are consistent over a long time, that the facts are understood by the leader, and that the reasoning is sound. What the constituents want is a factor, but a leader sometimes recognizes that the constituency is wrong.</p>

<p>What we can demand of our leaders is that they explain <em>why</em> they changed their minds. If it was a mistake in reasoning, correct it. If the situation changed in material way, tell us how. If it runs against the desires of the majority, lead us to a better understanding. And if it seems that a core principle has changed, explain how that came about.</p>
