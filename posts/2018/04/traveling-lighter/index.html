  <h1>Traveling lighter <aside></aside></h1>
  <p>I've spent a fair bit of time over the past few days thinking about how and what to pack for traveling, and sometimes it seems like <em>too</em> much time. Compared to some people, I don't travel that much. I may well be putting more time into thinking about it than I will ever recoup. Why bother?</p>

<p>The main reason, of course, is that traveling lighter means carrying less stuff, which is easier, less tiring, and less stressful in trying to get my stuff somewhere. A second reason is that I often don't really need everything I bring anyway. I carry quite a few things "just in case", and those cases rarely happen. Even if they did, I could almost certainly deal with the situation.</p>

<p>And, perhaps in a strange way, optimization problems are fun, at least for some of us. The challenge of doing more with less is intriguing, even if it seems trivial.</p>

<p>Last year I replaced my backpack--one I had been using for more years than I can remember. The one I got is smaller, and intentionally so. When I decided on it, after considerable research and looking at backpacks, I imagined my experience was likely to be: first, I'd be very happy with it almost all the time; second, I'd be occasionally annoyed that I couldn't put another book, magazine, or small set of papers in it; and third, I could get along with that extra stuff just fine. And pretty much, that's been how I feel about it. When I took all the regular items out of the old backpack, many of them didn't go in to the new one. In a way, right now I'm just going through the same process.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://tombihn.com" title="Tom Bihn">Tom Bihn</a> has some really nice bags, backpacks, and travel accessories.</p>
